# 📸 `features.md` – Unsplash Clone Photo Sharing App (with Machine Learning)

## 📘 Overview

This document outlines the planned features for a full-stack **photo sharing web app** similar to Unsplash, built with:

* **Frontend:** React
* **API & Auth Backend:** Django + Django REST Framework
* **Media Microservices & Concurrency:** Golang
* **Machine Learning Services:** Python ML models via REST/gRPC
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Object Storage:** Local
* **Deployment:** Docker + Kubernetes

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Features

### 🔎 Image Tagging & Auto Labeling

* Use pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, CLIP, YOLOv8) to auto-detect:

  * Scene types (e.g., beach, mountain, city)
  * Objects (e.g., dog, person, tree)
  * Contextual tags (e.g., sunset, abstract, portrait)
* Tags added automatically on upload

### 📷 NSFW & Content Moderation

* ML-based NSFW classification (e.g., using `nudenet` or `open_nsfw`)
* Auto-flag inappropriate content for admin review

### 🧬 Style & Aesthetic Analysis

* Assign an aesthetic score to photos (e.g., for trending sort)
* Recommend similar photos using image embeddings

### 🔥 Personalized Recommendations

* ML model suggests:

  * Photos similar to user's likes
  * Users to follow based on activity
* Uses vector similarity search (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone)

### 🗣️ Caption Suggestion (Optional)

* Auto-generate photo descriptions/captions using Vision-Language Models (e.g., BLIP-2, LLaVA)

---

## 👤 User Roles

* **Guest**: Browse and search photos
* **User**: Upload, like, comment, manage profile
* **Admin**: Moderate flagged content, monitor stats

---

## 📂 Core Features

### 🔐 Authentication

* JWT + OAuth2 (Google, GitHub)
* Email verification, password reset
* Role-based access

### 🖼️ Upload & Manage Photos

* Upload high-res photos
* Auto-tagging with ML
* Choose visibility: public/private
* View/edit/delete photos
* Track photo views/downloads

### 🔍 Search & Explore

* Tag-based search with ML-enhanced relevance
* Filter by orientation, popularity, color, style
* Trending photos and photographers

### 📊 Dashboard & Analytics

* **User Dashboard**:

  * Upload stats
  * Follower count, likes
* **Admin Dashboard**:

  * Flagged content review
  * Storage usage
  * ML model performance (optional)

## ⚒️ Tech Features

### 📡 API Endpoints (Django REST)

* `/api/photos/`
* `/api/users/`
* `/api/tags/`
* `/api/stats/`
* `/api/ml/classify/` ← ML model endpoints

### 🚀 Golang Microservices

* Image compression & thumbnailing
* Async processing with RabbitMQ/NATS
* Pre-serve optimization for fast delivery

### ⚙️ DevOps & Deployment

* Dockerized services (React, Django, Go, ML)
* Kubernetes (minikube/dev or production)
* CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions
* NGINX ingress for routing

---

## 🧹 Optional Add-Ons

* PWA for mobile experience
* Image license management
* Dark mode
* Public profile customization

## 💡 ML Model Integration Strategy

| ML Task         | Framework      | Model                 |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Auto-tagging    | PyTorch        | CLIP, YOLOv8          |
| NSFW detection  | TensorFlow     | OpenNSFW, NudeNet     |
| Recommendations | Python + FAISS | User/photo embeddings |
| Captioning      | HuggingFace    | BLIP, LLaVA           |

Microservices expose REST or gRPC endpoints, which Django consumes during uploads or dashboard updates.
